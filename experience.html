      <p>Here, I worked on a small team to develop an IoT monitoring device from 
      scratch. I was chiefly responsible for the circuit design, PCB layout, and electronics 
      manufacturing for both enterprise and consumer end users. In addition, I designed, 
      developed, and continued to maintain the product firmware, squashing bugs as soon
      as they were discovered. By the time I left Delta Five, our devices were being beta 
      tested by 7 operating businesses.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to our standard product focus, I performed several rapid prototypes
      for proof-of-principle validation, as well as designed a power supply
      <span id="and">&</span> computer system for a prototype mobile robot.
      </p>
      <p>Other duties included acting as the face of customer service 
      for our beta testing program, co-designing the interface for our web 
      dashboard, and maintaining/validating functionality through constant design
      iterations.

      <p>Working here during my senior year at NC State, I focused on the development 
      of a rechargeable power supply for a luminescent hoodie. I also developed 
      prototypes of a rechargeable illuminated streetwear hat. Neither ever made 
      it to production, but it was an important experience in learning development 
      and prototyping skills. Electric MVMT also was a sponsor for my 
      <a href="projects.html#outerwear">capstone project</a>, where I worked with
      a small team to develop a prototype for another emerging product.

      <p>I was formally introduced to C and Java, as well as
      controls, microprocessor optimization, and a full spectrum of circuit analysis. 
      I built several cool projects and a slew of boring ones. 
      </p>
      <p>Through a variety of group projects, I developed team leadership skills 
      and won a few awards. I'm most proud of being elected <span class="italics">
      Outstanding Senior Design Student</span> (see 
      <a href="projects.html#outerwear">capstone project</a>)
      from a class of 60+ students by both instructors, independently.

      <p>I traveled to Germany to work on security systems for European clients. Most of the
      internship focused on analyzing shipping data for cost savings and using 
      AutoCAD to organize and maintain security installation documentation.</p>

      <p>It was my first internship, so I can't say I did anything too impressive.
        I built my first GUI to support database interactions, and I supported
        the senior engineers with soldering <span id="and">&</span> board validation.
