      <p>Here, I've worked on a small team to develop an IoT monitoring device from 
      scratch. I was chiefly responsible for the circuit design, PCB layout, and electronics 
      manufacturing for both enterprise and consumer end users. In addition, I designed, 
      developed, and continue to maintain the product firmware.
      We are currently testing in 5 locations, including 3 operating business.
      </p><p>
      I also performed analysis and design of a power supply and computer system for a
      prototype surveillance robot.

      <p>Working here during my senior year at NC State, I focused on the development 
      of a rechargeable power supply for a luminescent hoodie. I also developed 
      prototypes of a rechargeable illuminated streetwear hat. Neither ever made 
      it to production, but it was an important experiencing in learning development 
      and prototyping skills. Electric MVMT also was a sponsor for my 
      <a href="projects.html#outerwear"> capstone project</a>, where I worked with
      a small team to develop a prototype of another product.

      <p>Got a degree here! I was formally introduced to C and Java, as well as
      controls, microprocessor optimization, and a full spectrum of circuit analysis. 
      I built several cool projects and plenty of boring ones. Through a variety 
      of group projects, I developed team leadership skills and won a few awards.</p>

      <p>Went to Germany to work on security systems for European clients. Most of the
